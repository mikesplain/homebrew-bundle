Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew.

[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/github/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle/coverage.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)

## Requirements

[Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) or [Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew) are used for installing the dependencies.
Linuxbrew is a fork of Homebrew for Linux, while Homebrew only works on macOS.
This tool is developed for use with Homebrew on macOS but might work with Linuxbrew (but is unsupported so don't file Linux issues, please).

[Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) is optional and used for installing Mac applications.

[mas-cli](https://github.com/argon/mas) is optional and used for installing Mac App Store applications.

## Install

`brew bundle` is automatically installed when run.

## Usage

Create a `Brewfile` in the root of your project with:

```
touch Brewfile
```

Add your dependencies in your `Brewfile`:

```ruby
cask_args appdir: "/Applications"
tap "homebrew/cask"
tap "telemachus/brew", "https://telemachus@bitbucket.org/telemachus/brew.git"
tap "telemachus/brew", pin: true
brew "imagemagick"
brew "mysql@5.6", restart_service: true, link: true, conflicts_with: ["mysql"]
brew "emacs", args: ["with-cocoa", "with-gnutls"]
cask "google-chrome"
cask "java" unless system "/usr/libexec/java_home --failfast"
cask "firefox", args: { appdir: "~/my-apps/Applications" }
mas "1Password", id: 443987910
```

### Install

You can then easily install all of the dependencies with:
```
$ brew bundle
```

If a dependency is already installed and there is an upgrade available it will be upgraded.

### Dump

You can create a `Brewfile` from all the existing Homebrew packages you have installed with:

```
$ brew bundle dump
```

The `--force` option will allow an existing `Brewfile` to be overwritten as well.

### Cleanup

You can also use `Brewfile` as a whitelist. It's useful for maintainers/testers who regularly install lots of formulae. To uninstall all Homebrew formulae not listed in `Brewfile`:

```
$ brew bundle cleanup
```

Unless the `--force` option is passed, formulae that would be uninstalled will be listed rather than actually be uninstalled.

### Check

You can check there's anything to install/upgrade in the `Brewfile` by running:

```
$ brew bundle check
```

This provides a successful exit code if everything is up-to-date so is useful for scripting.

For a list of dependencies that are missing, pass `--verbose`. This will also check _all_ dependencies by not exiting on the first missing dependency category.

### List

Outputs a list of all of the entries in the Brewfile.

```
$ brew bundle list
```

Pass one of `--casks`, `--taps`, `--mas`, or `--brews` to limit output to that type. Defaults to `--brews`. Pass `--all` to see everything.

Note that the _type_ of the package is **not** included in this output.

### Exec

Runs an external command within Homebrew's superenv build environment:

```
$ brew bundle exec -- bundle install
```

This sanitized build environment ignores unrequested dependencies, which makes sure that things you didn't specify in your `Brewfile` won't get picked up by commands like `bundle install`, `npm install`, etc. It will also add compiler flags which will help find keg-only dependencies like `openssl`, `icu4c`, etc.

### Restarting services

You can choose whether `brew bundle` restarts a service every time it's run, or
only when the formula is installed or upgraded in your `Brewfile`:

```ruby
# Always restart myservice
brew 'myservice', restart_service: true

# Only restart when installing or upgrading myservice
brew 'myservice', restart_service: :changed
```

## Note

Homebrew does not support installing specific versions of a library, only the most recent one, so there is no good mechanism for storing installed versions in a `.lock` file.

If your software needs specific versions then perhaps you'll want to look at using [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) to better match your development and production environments.

## Tests

Tests can be run with `bundle && bundle exec rake spec`
